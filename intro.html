            <h2>Introduction to Soil pH</h2>
            <p>Soil pH is crucial in gardening because it directly affects nutrient availability, plant health, and microbial activity. Most plants thrive in slightly acidic soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, where essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are most accessible. When soil pH is too low (acidic) or too high (alkaline), plants may exhibit nutrient deficiencies, poor growth, or health issues like yellowing leaves. The pH also influences the effectiveness of soil microorganisms that break down organic matter and cycle nutrients. Gardeners can adjust soil pH by adding lime to raise it or sulfur to lower it, depending on the needs of specific plants. Regular soil testing helps determine the pH and guide appropriate amendments, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth.</p>
