            <h2>Monitoring and Adjusting</h2>
            <p>Raising Soil pH: To address acidic soils, lime is commonly added. Lime neutralizes soil acidity by replacing acid ions with basic ones (e.g., calcium and magnesium). The amount of lime required depends on soil texture and other properties, which can be determined through soil testing. The Shoemaker-McLean-Pratt (SMP) buffer method is often used in Colorado to recommend appropriate lime amounts.
              Lowering Soil pH: This is typically done to address iron deficiencies in plants. However, it is difficult to lower pH in soils containing significant lime, as lime neutralizes acidification efforts. In non-lime soils, elemental sulfur is used to lower pH by converting to sulfuric acid, but this process takes time (months to a year). Monitoring and reapplying sulfur may be needed for ongoing adjustments.
